Fitbit Dataset Overview

# Dataset Background
This dataset was created from responses to a survey distributed through Amazon Mechanical Turk from March 12, 2016, to May 12, 2016. Thirty Fitbit users consented to share their tracker data, which includes minute-level details of physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The dataset reflects the variability in user tracking behaviors/preferences and the use of different Fitbit trackers. It encompasses 18 distinct files, covering aspects like daily activity, calories burned, step count, intensity of activities, and sleep patterns.
